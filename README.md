# CodeAlpha_Secure_Coding_Review
Reviewing code for the purpose of identifying security vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for secure coding practices.

### Secure Coding Review
Choose a programming language and application.
Review the code for security vulnerabilities and
provide recommendations for secure coding practices.
Use tools like static code analyzers or manual code
review.

### Let’s choose Python for our secure coding review. We’ll review a simple web application that handles user input and interacts with a database. Here’s a sample code snippet

Identified Security Vulnerabilities

SQL Injection: The code directly inserts user input into the SQL query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

Plaintext Password Storage: Storing passwords in plaintext is insecure and can lead to data breaches.
Lack of Input Validation: The code does not validate or sanitize user input, which can lead to various attacks like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).

Recommendations for Secure Coding Practices

Use Parameterized Queries: Prevent SQL injection by using parameterized queries.
Hash Passwords: Use a secure hashing algorithm to store passwords.
Input Validation and Sanitization: Validate and sanitize all user inputs.

Improved Code

Here’s the improved version of the code with the recommended security practices:

Tools for Secure Code Review

Static Code Analyzers: Tools like Bandit for Python can help identify security issues in your code.
Manual Code Review: Regularly review your code manually to catch issues that automated tools might miss.
